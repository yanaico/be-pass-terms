5.5 Third-Party Created Profiles and Consent for Public Information

Prior to creating such a profile, explicit consent will be obtained from the User to publish their personal information, which may include (but is not limited to):
• Full name
• Address

Consent may be collected via email, phone, message, or an online consent form. By providing consent, the User agrees to the public display of their information on the Be-Pass platform, making it accessible to clients and other Users.

Be-Pass maintains a record of this consent, including the date, time, User ID, and IP address, for legal and regulatory compliance.
Booking and Meeting Requests:
If a User provides another person’s details for booking or scheduling, Be-Pass creates a full user profile for that individual.
The new user will receive an account activation email, allowing them to access the platform and manage their details.
Users created through this method will have access to standard platform features, but permissions will be assigned separately based on their role and activities.
The new user may request modifications, role assignments, or account deletion at any time via bepassfeedback@gmail.com.
Users retain the right to:
• Request modifications to their displayed information.

7. Account Deletion
Once a User deletes their account, they will no longer be able to recover it. Be-Pass will permanently delete the User’s personally identifiable data within 90 days. However, certain residual data may remain in backup systems for up to 180 days. Data shared with other Users or made public (e.g., reviews, feedback, chat, booking) may remain visible.
7.1 Data Retention for Records and Classes
Even after a User deletes their account, certain information may remain in the system for purposes such as record-keeping, legal obligations, and maintaining the integrity of existing class-related data. Specifically:
1.	Class Participation Records
If a User has participated in classes, their participation records (e.g., attendance, feedback, or role in the class) may remain in the system to preserve historical data and ensure the continuity of service for other Users, such as freelancers managing those classes.
2.	Anonymization of Personal Data
In such cases, the User's personal data will be anonymized where possible (e.g., their name and contact details will be replaced or marked as "Deleted User") to maintain privacy while ensuring that essential information related to classes is retained.
3.	Purpose
The retention of class-related data is necessary to:
o	Provide accurate records for class management.
o	Comply with legal and contractual obligations.
o	Maintain the integrity of the service for other Users, including freelancers and clients who rely on these records.
7.2 Additional Considerations for Classes, Branches, and User Roles
1.	Class Status Changes (e.g., Canceled or Deleted Classes)
If a class is canceled or deleted, certain records related to the class, such as participant details and attendance, will be retained to maintain historical data and service integrity for other Users (e.g., freelancers or branch owners managing the classes). Personal details may be anonymized when no longer required for operational or legal purposes.
2.	Branch Management Data
Data related to branches, such as participant roles and branch-specific information, may be retained even when branches or associated classes are deleted or modified. This ensures continuity of service for branch owners and participants. Personal data will be anonymized where feasible.
3.	Ownership Transitions
In cases where branch or class ownership is transferred between Users, relevant data (e.g., class records, participant details) will also be transferred to ensure service continuity. Be-Pass will process this data in compliance with the Privacy Policy and applicable legal obligations.
4.	Roles and Responsibilities
Users with specific roles, such as CLASS_OWNER or BRANCH_OWNER, may have access to manage or delete data associated with their classes or branches. However, any such actions will comply with the data retention policies outlined here, and certain information may still be retained for legal, operational, or historical purposes.
